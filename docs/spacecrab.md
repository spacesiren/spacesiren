# SpaceCrab Critique

After seeing SpaceSiren, you may remember a similar project called
"[SpaceCrab](https://bitbucket.org/asecurityteam/spacecrab/src/master/)" from
Atlassian. This project was heavily inspired by SpaceCrab.

While I love the idea of SpaceCrab, there were a few issues with it that I
found difficult to get past. Namely...

* It's written in Python 2, a language that is now end-of-life and was already
  nearing deprecation when the project began.
* It uses AWS CloudFormation to provision the stack, which can be shaky when
  using nested templates. The SpaceCrab documentation even admits that it may
  fail randomly for no reason. Plus I'm more fond of Terraform just out of
  personal preference.
* It requires an RDS instance and a VPC NAT Gateway to operate. While that may
  be a drop in the bucket for most businesses, it's expensive for an individual
  to run on their own.
* Lack of alert integration options; only sends to email and PagerDuty.
* Each individual action performed with a honey token triggers its own alert.
  If an attacker attempts 5 actions, you will receive 5 separate emails or
  PagerDuty alerts.
* The project was active for only a year and has had no substantial commits
  within the last two years as of this writing.

In response, I've made the following improvements for SpaceSiren:

* It's written in Python 3.8, the latest stable version at the time the
  SpaceSiren project began.
* It uses Terraform to provision the stack.
* It's completely serverless! It's all powered on Lambda, DynamoDB, and API
  Gateway, all of which are pay-as-you-go. No full-time servers to run!
* In addition to email and PagerDuty, it supports Slack webhooks for alerts.
* Supports alert "cooldown", meaning it will suppress notifications for future
  events for a user-defined time after the first alert is triggered.
* While I can't sign a commitment to SpaceSiren's future development, I plan to
  keep it maintained for the foreseeable future. Plus I hope contributors will
  be more inclined to propose changes since the project is not run by a large
  company.

Just as I've taken inspiration from Atlassian for SpaceSiren, I hope they can
take inspiration from this project to improve SpaceCrab.
